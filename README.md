# Overview

This repository contains the code required for the Simulation component of the IMLS_GCCO marker comparison project, which is quantifying how measures of *ex situ* conservation differ between RADseq and microsatellite markers.
Simulations using different marker types are performed using the [fastSimcoal2 software](http://cmpg.unibe.ch/software/fastsimcoal27/).

### draft_fscParams folders
This folders contain the parameters for different simulation scenarios, with folder names describing the particular scenario being explored. The folder labeled `draft_fscParams` is the primary scenario set used in analyses.
Within each of these directories is the script used to run the simulations and two subfolders, one for MSAT parameter files and one for DNA parameter files

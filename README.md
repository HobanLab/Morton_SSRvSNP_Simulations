# Overview

This repository contains the code required for the Simulation component of the IMLS_GCCO marker comparison project, which is quantifying how measures of *ex situ* conservation differ between RADseq and microsatellite markers.
Simulations using different marker types are performed using the [fastSimcoal2 software](http://cmpg.unibe.ch/software/fastsimcoal27/).

### draft_20220210_fscParams
This contains the scripts and parameter files used in preliminary fastsimcoal2 runs, comparing DNA and MSAT marker types.
